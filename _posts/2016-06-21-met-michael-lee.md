title: Meeting Michael D. Lee - First encounter with Bayesian modeling!
date: 2016-06-21

### I meet Michael D. Lee on his second visit to UNAM.

I had the privilege of meeting <a class='link' href="http://faculty.sites.uci.edu/mdlee/">Michael D. Lee</a> during his second visit to UNAM. Little did I know at the time that he would later become one of my Ph.D. co-advisors at UC Irvine!

During his visit to Lab25, Michael gave two enlightening presentations that would significantly influence my research trajectory:

▸ An introduction to the benefits of Bayesian Modeling (<a class='link' href="/presentations/Lee_BayesianBenefits.pdf">View presentation</a>)

▸ A comprehensive overview of Bayesian Modeling in Cognitive Science (<a class='link' href="/presentations/Lee_June2016.pdf">View presentation</a>)

This visit marked my first formal exposure to Bayesian modeling, a framework that would later become central to my research work. Meeting Michael and learning about these methods sparked my interest in computational approaches to understanding cognitive processes.
