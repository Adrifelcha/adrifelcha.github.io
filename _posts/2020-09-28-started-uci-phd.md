### A New Chapter Begins!

In Fall 2020, I began my Ph.D. journey at the University of California, Irvine! I joined the Department of Cognitive Sciences under the mentorship of an exceptional team of advisors:

- <a href="https://www.faculty.uci.edu/profile/?facultyId=6237" target="_blank">Joachim Vandekerckhove</a> (Primary Advisor)
- <a href="https://www.faculty.uci.edu/profile/?facultyId=6493" target="_blank">Jeffrey N. Rouder</a>
- <a href="http://faculty.sites.uci.edu/mdlee/" target="_blank">Michael D. Lee</a> (Co-advisor)

### Joint Program (M.S. in Statistics)

I was admitted to UCI's joint program between the Department of Cognitive Sciences and the Department of Statistics, which allowed me to pursue both my Ph.D. in Cognitive Sciences and a Master's degree in Statistics. This interdisciplinary training has provided me with a strong foundation in both cognitive modeling and statistical methodology.

### Research Focus

My research at UCI focuses on developing and applying Bayesian hierarchical models to understand human cognition. I am particularly interested in:

- Signal Detection Theory
- Response Time Models
- Individual Differences in Decision Making

### Fellowship Support

I was honored to be supported by the UC MEXUS-CONACYT Fellowship, a collaborative program between the University of California Institute for Mexico and the United States (UC MEXUS) and Mexico's National Council for Science and Technology (CONACYT).
