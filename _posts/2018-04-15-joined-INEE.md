### I joined the National Institute for Education Evaluation (INEE)

Shortly after completing my bachelor's degree, I joined the National Institute for Educational Evaluation (INEE) in Mexico City as the lead psychometrist of the Basic Education Division at the Department of Assessment of Teachers and Principals. This role offered me a unique opportunity to apply my statistical and methodological skills to real-world educational challenges.

### Professional Development

During my time at INEE, I received comprehensive professional training in:
- Sampling methodologies
- Cognitive assessment models
- Observational research methods

### Key Responsibilities

My primary duties included:
- Reviewing psychometric indices of measurement instruments used to assess teachers and principals in primary and middle public schools
- Identifying items and specifications requiring improvements
- Supervising selection processes to evaluate item quality and adequacy
- Collaborating with field specialists to ensure test specifications met required standards

### Bridge to Graduate School

This experience proved invaluable in bridging my academic interests with practical applications. Working with large-scale assessments and complex psychometric models reinforced my desire to pursue advanced studies in quantitative methods, which later shaped my decision to pursue a joint Ph.D. in Cognitive Sciences and M.S. in Statistics at UC Irvine.
