### My journey into Cognitive Science began in Lab25.

In January 2015, I joined the <b>Learning and Adaptive Behavior Laboratory (Lab25)</b> at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), where I would spend the next three years working under the mentorship of Dr. Arturo Bouzas Riaño. This marked the beginning of my journey into cognitive science as an experimental psychologist.

### Research Focus

During my time at Lab25, I focused on experimental psychology and mathematical modeling. My undergraduate thesis explored the generalizability of the mirror effect—a pattern typically observed in recognition memory tasks—to visual perception tasks. Using the Ebbinghaus illusion, I designed and programmed experiments that compared performance across different difficulty levels (manipulated through the number of surrounding circles).

### Teaching & Development

My involvement at Lab25 extended far beyond research:
- Head teaching assistant for the undergraduate course series "Aprendizaje y Conducta Adaptativa I, II & III" (Learning and Adaptive Behavior)
- Senior undergraduate mentor for laboratory courses designed for students interested in research

One of my main contributions was spearheading the development of interactive educational tools. Using RShiny and Jupyter Notebook, I created applications that helped students understand complex mathematical models in psychology through hands-on exploration. As a senior lab member, I also participated actively in grant writing to support our lab's funding initiatives.
