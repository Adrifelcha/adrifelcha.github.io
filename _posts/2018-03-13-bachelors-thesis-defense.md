### Thesis Overview

My research explored the generalizability of the Mirror Effect—a phenomenon well-documented in recognition memory—to the domain of visual perception. Using Signal Detection Theory and the Ebbinghaus illusion, we demonstrated how patterns typically observed in memory tasks could also emerge in pure perception tasks.
