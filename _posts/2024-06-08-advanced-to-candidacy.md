### I advanced to candidacy!

On June 8th, 2024, I advanced to candidacy in my Ph.D. program at UC Irvine!

I presented my dissertation proposal under the tentative title "Modeling individual differences in choice and response time". Upon deliveration, my committee members agreed that the proposal was well-structured and that I was ready to advance to candidacy (Hurrayyy!!).

I am very grateful to have been blessed with such a supportive and talented committee:

- [Dr. Joachim Vandekerckhove](https://faculty.uci.edu/profile/?facultyId=6237)
- [Dr. Michael D. Lee](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/mdlee/)
- [Dr. Jeffrey N. Rouder](https://www.faculty.uci.edu/profile/?facultyId=6493)
