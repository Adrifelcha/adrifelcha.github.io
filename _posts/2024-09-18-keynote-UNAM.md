### Returned to my alma mater to deliver an invited keynote presentation

I had the honor of returning to my alma mater, UNAM, to deliver an invited keynote presentation alongside my former Lab25 colleague, Darío Trujano. It was a special moment to share our research journeys that began in this very institution.

### Research Presentations

The session featured two talks showcasing different applications of Bayesian modeling in psychology:

- "Modelamiento grafico Bayesiano con el modelo de difusion circular" (Bayesian Graphical Modeling with the Circular Diffusion Model) by me!
- "¿Cuánto pagar por descubrir? Comparando a Bayes y el comportamiento" *(How much to pay for discovery? Comparing Bayes and behavior)* by Darío Trujano

### Watch the Talk (in Spanish)

Presenting at UNAM as an invited speaker was particularly meaningful, as it represented a full circle moment in my academic journey. From my undergraduate days at Lab25 to returning as a senior Ph.D. candidate from UC Irvine, this talk symbolized both personal growth and the enduring connection between these two institutions that have shaped my academic career.
