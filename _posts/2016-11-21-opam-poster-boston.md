### OPAM, 2016 : First international poster presentation!

I had the exciting opportunity to present my undergraduate research at the 2016 Object Perception, Attention, and Memory (OPAM) meeting in Boston, Massachusetts. This was my first international conference attendance!

### Research Overview

My poster explored the generalizability of the Mirror Effect—a well-documented empirical phenomenon in Recognition Memory—to the domain of visual perception. The Mirror Effect typically shows that when comparing performance between different classes of stimuli (e.g., high vs. low-frequency words), there are systematic differences in both hit rates and false alarm rates.

In this project, I explored the Mirror Effect outside of memory tasks, specifically in a pure perception task. I designed an experiment using the Ebbinghaus illusion to create conditions of differential discriminability, applying Signal Detection Theory to analyze participants' performance.
