Hello! Thank you for visitin my personal website!

My name is Adri, I'm a 30 year-old grad Ph.D. student at the Cognitive Sciences department of the University of California Irvine. During my time there, I've been blessed with the opportunity to work with Jeff Rouder, Michael D. Lee and Joachim Vandekerckhove, (words cannont express how lucky I am!).

As a Cognitive Scientist, I am interested in the application of Bayesian methods.

As a sentient being, I choose to believe that happiness begins with a touch of kindness. 

# Ice breakers (?)
1. 
2. I am really into ASMR, it helps me sleep when I'm under a lot of stress.
3. I have a strong interest in making statistics as accessible as possible.
